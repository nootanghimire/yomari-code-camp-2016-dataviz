#Description

There are three demo here, which will be integrated to a main UI later. 

There is also a d3.js library, and under the folder `data`, the extracted and
processed data are stored. The process of extracting data from the initial pdf
(not uploaded because it was heavy) can be found on `../data_extraction_scripts`.
