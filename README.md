#Data Visualization

This project is aimed at showing the impact of visualization compared to flat raw data published by Organizations. 

The specific Organization this project is aimed is the "Agricultral Organization". 

#Description

We acknowledge and assume that a complete solution for a complex situation is not something that we can do in a day or two, 
there are a lot of factors that should be taken into consideration, pragmatic issues and lot more. So in this hackathon, 
what we really plan is to provide a prototype for an application that has a potential in the context of Nepal. 

Nepal Government urges its organizations to publish their data to the general public, and it has been doing so for some time now.
But there is a difference between just some statistics and a organized, meaningful, and comprehensive information.
And seeing the trends, we have been only shown the former type of data - raw, unmeaningful, incomprehensible data.

The major aim of this project is to show that data should not be kept in unmeaningful and incomprehensible format - rather, it's 
true potential is seen by its comprehensibility and its usability. 

We touch a small portion of this by trying to visualise the data and compare the comphrehensibility between the pictured, interactive
represetation of the data vs tabulated text-based data. 

There is a important thing that needs to be considered while we discuss about visualising the data. For some data to be image-ified 
we need data in a programmable, if not standard format. This hints to the realization that tasks of visualization would be easier 
if the data were in some standard format. There are specifications specified internationally for that, so in a longer term - if we
are able to implement it in at least some organization, our goal will be shifting towards policy updates making organizations release
data in standard format. 

#Why is it really necessary?

Texts are hard to read. Longer texts are hard to grasp. Suppose there is a three-page long data; Would you really go through all of 
the text? or would you prefer a visual representation - maybe a line graph that shows you the bigger picture? There is the answer.
We all like visuals and interactions rather than textual representation but there lacks an initiation to do so - at least in the 
agricultural world of nepal. Thus, with this project, we would like to initiate the idea that says "Yes, Visualization is the way 
to go! It makes everyone job's easier!". This is what this project aims to pursue!
